# --- work the captain is already holding: pane churn must not re-alarm -------
# The other record of a legitimate wait. The declared-wait bound above reads the
# status LINE, and a delivered task's line stays `done: PR ...` while the wait
# itself lives in the BACKLOG, written there by bin/fm-captain-hold.sh. No line
# predicate can see that record, so both stale alarms - the captain-relevant one
# and the inconclusive one - re-fired on every new pane hash for as long as the
# captain was deciding, which is the 2026-09 loop observed on delivered work
# awaiting their merge word.
# Pinned here, in both directions: while the call stands the first sight still
# alarms, further sights of the SAME call and status-log state are absorbed, and
# a new pane hash after the window's end alarms once more; and the identical
# fixture WITHOUT the hold keeps alarming on every hash, because a bound that
# swallowed an unheld delivery or blocker would be worse than the churn it removes.
#
# The backlog is real rather than a fixture file: bin/fm-captain-hold.sh is the
# only writer of a hold and tasks-axi the only reader, so a hand-written row
# would pin this test's idea of a hold instead of the one the watcher consults.
#
# Cost: every case below drives churn through ONE watcher process rather than
# relaunching per pane change. Watcher startup dominates a round here, and an
# absorbing watcher stays in its poll loop across churn in production anyway, so
# the cheaper shape is also the more faithful one.

# The window key every hold fixture uses, derived the way fm-watch.sh derives it.

# inconclusive one. The hold is invisible to the status line in both, so both
