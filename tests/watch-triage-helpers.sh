# tests/watch-triage-helpers.sh - shared fixtures for the fm-watch-triage*
# suites, which cover the always-on wake triage built into bin/fm-watch.sh and
# the shared classifier (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh). The watcher absorbs the benign
# majority of wakes in bash and exits ONLY on an actionable wake, so firstmate's
# LLM re-arms once per actionable event instead of once per wake.
#
# The suite is split across several tests/fm-watch-triage*.test.sh files so no
# single file outlives a per-script bound on a loaded host and the CI shards can
# balance it. Each file owns one behavior area and sets its own TMP_ROOT after
# sourcing this file; a helper lives here only when more than one of those files
# uses it.
#
# Daemon-side classification/injection lives in fm-daemon.test.sh; watcher/lock
# liveness in fm-watcher-lock.test.sh; the durable-queue safety matrix in
# fm-wake-queue.test.sh.
