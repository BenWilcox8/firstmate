# Herdr injects HERDR_ENV, HERDR_PANE_ID, HERDR_TAB_ID, HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID,
# HERDR_SOCKET_PATH, and HERDR_SESSION into every process it manages a pane for
# (verified 0.7.5 - docs/verification/runtime-backends.md), and a test run from
# inside a Herdr pane inherits all of them. Spawn now treats that pane as the
# authoritative parent to place workers next to, so a leaked identity from the
# developer's own session would follow the test into its isolated lab session
# and be refused there as a cross-session parent - a result that depends on
# where the suite was launched from, not on what it asserts.
#
# Call this before exporting the lab HERDR_SESSION in any suite whose subject is
# the per-home container path. A suite that means to exercise a launcher-bound
# spawn sets HERDR_PANE_ID itself, to a pane it created in its own lab session.

# herdr_forget_inherited_home: drop the FM_HOME this test process inherited

#
# bin/backends/herdr.sh derives a home's workspace LABEL from FM_HOME (the
# primary is "firstmate", a seeded secondmate home is "2ndmate-<id>"). A suite
# launched from inside a firstmate worker inherits that worker's FM_HOME, so
# label-dependent assertions would then depend on which home started the run
# instead of on what they assert. Unsetting it restores the adapter's own
# documented fallback - the repo root, which carries no secondmate marker - so
# the label is "firstmate" exactly as it is in CI.
#
# Call this in any suite that asserts on container placement or workspace
# labels. A suite that means to exercise a specific home sets FM_HOME itself.
